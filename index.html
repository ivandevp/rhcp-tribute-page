					<h2>RHCP History:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Early history (1983–1984)</strong> - 
							Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in Los Angeles by singer Anthony Kiedis, guitarist Hillel Slovak, bassist Flea, and drummer Jack Irons, all of whom were classmates from Fairfax High School
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Building a following and Slovak's death (1985–1988)</strong> -
							George Clinton produced the next album, Freaky Styley (1985). Clinton combined various elements of punk and funk into the band's repertoire, allowing their music to incorporate a variety of distinct styles.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Successful new line-up (1988–1989)</strong> -
							After losing two of the original band members, Flea and Kiedis started looking for musicians to fill those spots. Shortly after Irons departure they chose as Slovak's replacement DeWayne "Blackbyrd" McKnight, former member of Parliament-Funkadelic and who at one point briefly filled in for Slovak, when he was temporarily fired.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Breakthrough, international fame and Frusciante's first departure (1990–1993)</strong> - 
							In 1990, after the success of Mother's Milk, the group decided they had enough with EMI and entered a major label bidding war ultimately signing with Warner Bros. Records and hired Rick Rubin to produce their then-untitled fifth album.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Transitional period (1993–1997)</strong> - 
							Navarro first appeared with the band at Woodstock '94. The band opened their set wearing enormous light bulb costumes attached precariously to chrome metallic suits, making it near-impossible for them to play their instruments.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Return of Frusciante and new-found popularity (1998–2001)</strong> - 
							In the years following his departure from the band, it became public that John Frusciante had developed a heroin addiction, which left him in poverty and near death.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Continued success (2001–2007)</strong> - 
							The writing and formation of the band's next album, By the Way began immediately following the culmination of Californication's world tour, in the Spring of 2001. As with Californication, much of the creation took place in the band members' homes, and other locations of practice, such as a recording studio stage.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Hiatus and Frusciante's second departure (2008–2009)</strong> - 
							Following the last leg of the Stadium Arcadium tour, the band members took an extended break. Kiedis attributed this to the band being worn out from their years of nonstop work since Californication (1999).
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Klinghoffer replaces Frusciante and I'm with You (2010–2013)</strong> -
							The band, with Josh Klinghoffer on guitar, made their live comeback on January 29, 2010, paying tribute to Neil Young with a cover of "A Man Needs a Maid" at MusiCares.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Eleventh studio album (2014–present)</strong> - 
							The Chili Peppers joined Bruno Mars as performers at the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show on February 2, 2014, to which a record 115.3 million viewers tuned in. The band's performance was met with mixed reviews from fans, the media, and even musicians towards Flea and Klinghoffer for performing to pre-recorded music; Flea responded that it was a NFL rule for bands to pre-record music due to time and technical issues, and that the band agreed because it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. He said Kiedis' vocals were completely live and the band pre-recorded "Give it Away" during rehearsals.
